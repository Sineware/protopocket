# Sineware Protopocket

The Protopocket is an open source reference development platform for mobile mainline Linux. It's a chonky phone you can build yourself!

## Why?
While there are many great phones that can run Linux today, the Protopocket fills a niche of being designed specifically for development purposes, and being fully OSHW that any individual can build themselves. While it won't be great as a daily driver:
- Builds on a well support, predictable platform (Raspberry Pi)
- Easy to debug (easy serial access)
- Modular (Swap in different hardware to test as needed)

## Hardware
The hardware as defined in this repository is "rolling", the specifications, configs, devicetrees, etc will evolve as the projects develops.

Current hardware:
- 3D printable case
- Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5
- Waveshare Mini Base Board (B) CM5
